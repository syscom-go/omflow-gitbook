# Version Specification

## Naming Rules

OMFLOW version numbers are divided into 4 codes:

1. The first code is *Generation Update*: This code will be updated when the product has changed to a different programming language or is launched in a completely new form.
2. The second code is for *Major Update*: This code will be updated when a brand new service is added.
3. The third code is for *feature update*: This code will be updated when adding or optimizing features within the existing product framework.
4. The fourth code is *bug fix*: This code will be updated when a bug is fixed.

## Update Rules

Before each update, please confirm the version number of OMFLOW you are currently running. The update range can be *only one feature update version number (third code)*, such as 1.2.1.X → 1.2.2.X.

For versions prior to 1.2.0, please refer to the following rule table:

| Updated Version Number | Range of OMFLOW Version Numbers Available for Update |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1.2.0.1 | 1.2.0.0 - 1.2.0.1 |
| 1.2.0.0 | 1.1.6.3 |
| 1.1.6.3 | 1.1.6.0 - 1.1.6.3 |

The characters to the right of the version number do not affect the update rules, such as 1.1.6.3fix3.
